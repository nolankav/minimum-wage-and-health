For each row in the results table, all of the policies in the record were in place from at least 'Date Policy Begins' to at least 'Date Policy Ends'. For example, if 'Date Policy Begins' is 2012/01/01 and 'Date Policy Ends' is 2012/10/01, the policies in that row were all in effect from at least January 1, 2012 through October 1, 2012. Every row comes from a different 'record' in the database, and a new record is coded whenever any of the policies in that category changes. If the policy that changed is not a policy being examined in a particular query, the results may show two rows for the same state that have identical information other than different (and adjacent) date ranges.
